        <h2>Traveling in Middle-earth</h2>
        <p>
            Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, 
            Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine 
            Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black 
            Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, 
            who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. 
            Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, 
            where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which 
            swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The 
            hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with 
            great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.

                        <h3>Walls of Moria</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Walls of Moria were the western rocky cliffs
                            at the base of the Misty Mountains. 
                            The Doors of Durin were built upon that surface, 
                            and by the craft of its makers, the doorway blended 
                            into it when closed. Before the Walls, there was a shallow 
                            valley climbing westward to a small cliff and then to a road 
                            between the Stair Falls, and the ancient Eregion.

                            Rivendell, or Imladris, was an Elven outpost in the Misty Mountains on the eastern edge of Eriador. 
                            Due to its location, it was called the Last Homely House from the point of view of a traveller going 
                            to the Misty Mountains and Wilderland; and also the First Homely House from the point of view of 
                            someone coming from these lands to the civilised lands of Eriador to the west.

                            Mordor was a land in the south-east of the Westlands east of Gondor. 
                            During most of the Second and Third Ages it was ruled by Sauron and 
                            it was his dwelling and base from which he attempted to conquer 
                            Middle-earth.

                            Minas Tirith (S. 'Tower of the Guard') was a city of Gondor, 
                            originally called Minas Anor. From T.A. 1640 onwards it was 
                            the capital of the South-kingdom and the seat of its Kings 
                            and ruling Stewards.
