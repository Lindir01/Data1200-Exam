### Font

### Color

### Misc
- Solid easy to follow table of content for every page( the side-nav? )
- Make sure we have padding/whitespace around elements
- Left-align text, we can center boxes, but it makes it hard to read and to find the start/end of sentences if they're not Left-aligned
- Make sure we have alt-text or aria-label for every media piece. Some images are smart for context on a quick view for sighted users
